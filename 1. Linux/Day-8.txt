User Management:


Linux: Multi user OS
Windows: Single user OS

How many user?
depends on u 

1. sudo/super/root user:
* Admin in windows
* unlimited powers/ access
* whenever u create a server like any of the user EC2 AWS/MS Azure/GCP,
it is created Automatically by ur OS

sudo gets create

2. Normal user: 
we r the normal user/we r going to create it

to create a Normal user:
1. switch to root ---->normal
   sudo su
2. useradd ---->to create a normal user
   a.# useradd balu ---->user name by balu is created

     To confirm user created or not?
     or
     b. UID ia Assigned
     
     c. GID is Assigned

   2.# id balu ----> if the user exit,
                     it gives the information
               ----> if the user does not exit,
                     it will says user does not found.
   3.# now the user is created,
       i need to set the password 
     # passwd balu
       New password: 123
       Retype new password: 123
     #

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Linux

Lab:
go to AWS Console,
EC2,
Ubuntu,
connect,

copy SSH

go to git bash here,
$ paste SSH
$ enter
enter
yes


ubuntu@ip$ sudo su <---->switching normal user to root user
root@ip:/home/ubuntu#

# whoami
root


her,
sudo ---->is a command ---->super user
su stands for switch user


root@ip:/home/ubuntu# sudo su ubuntu
ubuntu$ sudo su
root@p:/home/ubuntu#

# useradd balu ---->user name by balu is created

#just to confirm that user---->balu is created or not?
# id balu 
uid:1010(balu) gid=1011(balu) groups=1010(balu)

          ----> if the user exit,
                it gives the information
          ----> if the user does not exit,
                it will says user does not found.

# now the user is created,
i need to set the password 
# passwd balu
New password: 123
Retype new password: 123
#

::::::::::::::::::::::::::
using another user,
# useradd divya ---->user name by divya is created

*just to confirm that user---->divya is created or not?
# id divya 
uid:1010(divya) gid=1012(divya) groups=1010(divya)

* now the user is created,
i need to set the password 
# passwd divya
New password: 1234
Retype new password: 1234
#

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Details of User file
or
whenever user created,
these users(like divya/balu) r stored at this file(/etc/password)
# cat /etc/password
:
:
:
dog:x:1009:1001::/home/dog:/bin/bash
balu:x:1010:1011::/home/balu:/bin/sh
divya:x:1011:1012::/home/divya:/bin/sh

# 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Shell
21:20

inside ur OS<----> u have a Shell

user enters the input

shell types:
1. bash
2. sh
3. ksh
4. chsh ---->change shell

git bash,
# chsh bash
bash does not exit

# chsh ksh
ksh does not exit

note: not required
:::::::::::::::::::
git bash,

root@ip:/home/ubuntu# su balu
$ 
Press control + D ---->to come out

# su divya
$
Press control + D ---->to come out

# cat /etc/password
:
:
:
dog:x:1009:1001::/home/dog:/bin/bash
balu:x:1010:1011::/home/balu:/bin/sh ---->a default shell
divya:x:1011:1012::/home/divya:/bin/sh ---->a default shell

here,
/bin/sh ---->whenever a user is created,
a default shell i.e., /bin/sh is created

so we need to change sh to bash
(/bin/bash to /bin/sh)

# sudo chsh -s /bin/bash divya
#
  execute command/enter
here,
chsh is change shell

# cat /etc/password
:
:
:
dog:x:1009:1001::/home/balu:/bin/bash
balu:x:1010:1011::/home/balu:/bin/sh 
divya:x:1011:1012::/home/divya:/bin/bash ---->so earlier its sh, but  now its bash

Process management:

-->ps        -->list out current running  process

-->ps  -aux (ps -ef) --> list out all the process 

--> Top      --> list out all the procees show the more information

--> Htop    -->  to and htop is same but htop desply coloueful data.

--> PID --> process id used manageing the CPU..


-->Avg cpu utilization is more wheather my application perforamance  is good or bad.?

ans)---> perforance is less


---------------

apt --> ubantu
yum --> centos/red


1)Install appache2 (web apllication)

2)check application running or not

3)stop the application

fallow below steps:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

-->sudp apt install apache2

-->sudo service apache2 status           --syntax(sudo service application name keyword)

--> sudo service apache2 stop

--> sudo service apache2 start

--> sudo service apache2 restart

--> sudo service apache2 reload

--> ps -ef | grep "apache2"                --> checking the application



greaceful method:

sudo service app  start/stop/restart


forcefully method:

kill -9 id(14843)        -->id(process id)

--> uptime   --> used to show the how many hours it is running..


Networking  Command;
SSH (secure shell)
--> ssh is a commend used to connect with server..

-->ssh starnds for connecting the local system to server

SCP(secure copy)
scp as like cp command used to copy the files and directories..

--> Between the 2 servers.

cp and scp both woks same

(Rsync) (same as like scp):

Rsync is used to copy the data to one server to another server.. while transfering the data if any network issue is happen it will start 
where it is stoped.
if it is SCP it will start froom the beginning..


10gb file


if any network issue is there it networks ia back procees is start from where is it was exicted the last tme..
