:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Lab:
Linux

vi --->normal notepad
vim ---->notepad++


:::::::::::::::::::::
Linux:
Lab

1. Grep:
Lets us create a file by name ---->grep.txt

$ vi grep.txt

.linux

windows

macos

andrios

Linux

windows

macos

andrios

Linux

windows

macos

andrios

:wq!

$ cat grep.txt
Linux
windows
macos
andrios
:
:


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
$ ls
grep.txt

so this is my file---->grep.txt,
now i want to search for a particular patter

$  grep "Linux" grep.txt
Linux Linux

$ cat grep.txt
:
:

$ grep -i "Linux" grep.txt
:
:-----> it search in both cap & small cases
-i ---->case Insensitive

# how many times pattern is repeated(count/times)
$ grp -in "linux "grep.txt
:1:linux
:9:linux
:
n---->stands for no.of times/lines
in which particular line is displays

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
# i want to see how many times this file/pattern(like linus) is repeated in this file

$ grep -ic "Linux" grep.txt
3 ---->3 times repeating


here,
c is how many times the pattern is repeating is count 
or
c is no' of times

$ vi grep.txt

add somethings 

like

WAL

$ grep -i "Linux" grep.txt 
Linux
:
:
:

dont want to search for unnesserry patterns
only exact match need to find

1.
$ grp -iw "linux" grep.txt
Linux
linux 

note: exact match
but its ignoring prefix & suffic(WLA)


Here,
w is is for both capital & small

2. 
$ grep -inw "linux" grep.txt
1:linux
9:linux

note:
here,
we can use all the 3---->inw,

i ---->case insensitive,
n ---->no of lines,
w ----> for exact match

$ grep -incw "linux" grep.txt
2 ---->it is just counting the no.of elements
note: should not use

3. 
# by using exact match(both prefix & sufix)---->w
grep -iw "linux" grep.txt
linux
Linux
windows linux andr

4.
$ grep -inw "linux grep.txt" | grep -c "linux" 
2 

note: 
file name is not needed for input of the file

:::::::::::::::::::::::::
or
1.
$ grep -iw "linux" grep.txt
linux
Linux
windows linux andr

2.
$ grep -ic "linux" grep.txt
5

3.
$ grep -in "linux" grep.txt
1:linux
9:Linux
17:linuxwindows
21:windows linux andr
23:windows linux andr

:::::::::::
i want to search for a pattern--->"linux"
but i dont know abt file name--->like grep.txt
 
$ grep -i "linux" *    
here,
*----> all means it will search in all the files & directories in ur current/present working directory(pwd)
:
:
note:
not in ur entire OS,
its searches in ur cwd only in linux dir.
* stands for every directories
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
wt is diff b/w l & i
$ grep -i "linux" 
linux
Linux

$ grep -l "linux" ---->l is in which ever file /dir name "linux" is exit, will see

copydir
grep.txt
 
$ grep -lr "linix"
grep.txt

here r is recursively

:::::::::::::::::::::
searching multiple patterns with file(grep.txt)

$ grep -ie "linux" -ie "windows" grep.txt
l
w
l
w
l
w

$ grep -ie "linux" -ie "windows" -ie "macos" grep.txt
:
:
macos

:::::::::::::::::::::::::
38:00

i want to see/display all the files which r ending .txt extention

$ ls
grep.txt
:


$ ls *.txt ---->* means all
:
: ---->displays all file names eding with txt

$ ls f*
f1.txt 
f2.txt 
f3.txt ---->displays starting with "f"

i want to search for a pattern in file2
i know the starting letter
but

or

i have a file wth some text,

hello
hi
hw
happy

i want to search for a particular pattern

but pattern must begin/star with "h"
im not bother with other word

there is a symbol called as 
^ ----> to specify beginning (cap symbol),
$ ----> ending ---->is---->exactly opposit 


"^h"---->then it will start the word wich r starting with "h"

$ ls
:
:
:

$ cat file1.txt
:
:---->this is the content of my file

i want to serach for all the parttern all ---->word "L"

$ grep -i "^h" file1.txt
$ ---->theres no words with starting h
$ 
$ grep -i "^l" file1.txt ---->it is small "L"
linuxs
: 
:
:----->displays words starting with "L"
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
i want to start with all the words,
lin,
$ grep -i "^lin" file1.txt
:

$ grep -i "^mac" file1.txt
:

$ grep -i "^mac" *
:
:
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
$ symbol---->ending
display all the words ending with x

"^h" ---->begin/start
"x$" ---->ending

$ grep -i "s$" file1 ---->which must end with "s"
windows
linuxs
:
: ---->display all the words ending with s

$ grep -i "os$" file1
:
:
macos
linusos
windowsos ---->display all the words ending with os

:::::::::::::::
Assignment:
1. just take some name
i want to show all the names starting with S
sowmya
sachin
satya
sai
s
krupal abc
pavan
sun

$ ls
:
:

$ cat names
:
:

$ grep -i "^s" names
sowmya
sachin
satya
sai
s ---->displays names starting with S

$ grep -i "^k" names
krupal abc ---->displays names starting with K

$ grep -i "n$" names ---->displays all the names which r ending with "n"
sachin
pavan
sun---->displays names ending with "n"
 
-----------------------------------------------
i want to display name begins with s & ending with n
$ 

do it

Tee ---->o/p of the command to a particular file 
> ---->o/p of the command to the file

$ ls > abc ---->">" is redirect
$ ls
:
: ---->means copy all the content to abc file

$ ls | tee abcd 
:
: copies that o/p to this file

lets us see how create AWS server,
& login to the account.


go to Aws console,
EC2,
instances

to create a server,
Lauch instances,
Name: ubuntu-server
select os: ubuntu
key pair: its a password to login into system

create a new kp or use it from drop down

RSA
.pem

create kp

Launch Instance

----------------------
go to EC2,
ubuntu-server,
click on connect
SSh client
copy ---->Example

go to downloads,
KP,
right click on it to open git bash here,
$ paste example here
enter
