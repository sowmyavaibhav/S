Git:
Git is Open Source and 
VCS.

Version Control Systems: 
it is used to store text based files in ur centralized repository.
or
is a practise which helps to store, monitor & track version of text based files & directories.
or
Common locations to store all ur files.
& track 
& Monitor files

To solve:
* to store in Local systems,
* instead of storing in our Local repo, we r storing in centralized repo.
(centralized repo: is like some center person)
* track---->who made wt changes 

Use:
* Parallel development (everybody can work parallelly)
  means: Multiple ppl r working at multiple things at the same time in git repo.
* Authorization : u can add/give permissions to work on centralized repo.
* Who, When & What ---->everything is tracked
(who made the changes,
When  made the changes 
& 
What made the changes)

* Versioning-Backup of that particular file. (Changes)

              Bank       VCS
   Client:    Phonepe    Git
   Server:    HDFC       Github,Bitbucket


2. Repository:

   ----> Repository is nothing but Folders all the files  in a particular project is stored & maintained. 
   (for each & every project)
