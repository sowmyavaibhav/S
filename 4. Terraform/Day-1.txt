Infrastructure - laptop might be a infrastructure. 
Simple it's a hardware, software, n/w, PPL, process all put together is infra.

Is nothing but resource required to perform ur day to day activities. 

Resource - Item, asset 

Q. How to create infra? 
Ans: 
1st way:
By using AWS console 

2nd way:
Imperative way/method:
Like by writing with programming language like python, shell scripting 

Create infra ----> Step by step manner/ approach to create infrastructure by using programming language 

Problems associated with imperative method:
1. Create lot of documents 
2. It's not a scalable approach 
   Scalable means Scale-In & Scale-Out 
                  * Increasing the resources & Decreasing the resources.
3. No History/version of ur infra is saved
4. Not a Cloud agnostic solutions
   Means- same file/scripts can be used for different cloud services.(Min changes)


These 4 problems r Mutable infra 

Mutable means not changeable 
Or
Mutable infra- Infrastructure where u not able to track history (no history is saved)
Same infra u can not be able to modify again & again

3rd way:
Declarative way:
We just need to tell wt we want 
&
How to do it ....
will be taken care by automation 

1. No need to create documents 
2. Scalable ----> provide no. Of instances 
3. History can be tracked, 
   modify again & again. 
4. Immutable infra
5. Cloud agnostic solutions
   Means- same file/scripts can be used for different cloud services.(Min changes)

In Declarative way,
We can use Different tools to create infra like

1. Terraform 
2. Pulomi
3. Cloud formation by using cloud ----> works only for AWS cloud,
   In azure- arm templates

Terraform:
          * Is a infrastructure automation tool,
            which helps us to create a new infrastructure, 
            Modify infrastructure 
            & 
            all the changes can be tracked.

            * Tf works on the concept of IAC-Infrastructure As A Tool.

IAC means- tells the file
           Wtever infrastructure we need to create 
           by using HCL - harshi corp language 
           will give it to tf,
           Then tf will create wtever infrastructure need to create & automates.

Interview tools:
1. Kubernetes 
2. AWS
3. Terraform 
4. Prometheus & grafana 
5. CI CD - Jenkins
6. Docker 
7. Ansible 
8. Git GitHub 
9. Linux 
10. Sonarqube
11. Trivy
12. Etc
