AWS Topics:
1. Attach 1 EBS volume to Multiple 
   servers
2. To Resize/change EBS volume
3. Deletion on Termination:
4. AMI
   1. Default OS/AMI
   2. Customise OS/AMI

EBS: 

Yesterday:

Create
1. Create & Attach
2. Detach & Attach
3. Attach 1 EBS volume to Multiple servers
all EBS volumes does not support Multiple  servers
few will supports
::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1. Attach 1 EBS volume to Multiple servers

Lab:

1. create EBS volume,
go to AWS console,
EC2,
EBS
Volumes,
create a volume,

Note:
if u see in Provisioned IOPS SSD, u'll find only there's a option ---->Enable Multi-Attach

Volume type: General Purpose SSD (gp3)
Size (GiB) : 1

Volume type:  Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
Size (GiB) : 1

Enable Multi-Attach

so by this way u can attach EBS volume to Multiple servers using only with Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2. To Resize/change EBS volume:

if u want to increase the size,
go to EBS volume,
select the volume,
Action,
Modify the volume,

size: 10

$ lsblk
:
:
xvda 10GB Disk
:
:


now change 10 GB to 11 GB,

go to console,
size: 11

modify

$ lsblk
:
:
xvda 10GB Disk
:
:


$ lsblk
:
:
xvda 11GB Disk ----->changed to 11 GB
:
:

:::::::::::::::::::::::
if u resize the EBS volume,
if it does not reflects in lsblk command,
then try to run below commands,

# if u creating for Ext4 file systems,
$ sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf1

# if u creating for xfs file systems,
$ sudo xfs-growfs /dev/xvdf


go to server,
$ lsblk
:
: 9GB disk

$ sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf1
:
:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Volumes: r nothing but virtual Hard drives

Volume types:
1. EBS ----->file storage
2. EFS ----->Block storage, old technology

Diff:
1. Increase performance
2. Time is less
3. IPOS is Increased
4. Durability
5. Availablity

Diff B/w EBS EFS

EFS
1. Block storage
2. pay for Provisioned capacity
3. Limited storage
4. Increase/decreased size manually
5. stored redundantly in a single AZ
6. 99% Availability
7. faster performance 
8. Automated Backups & snapshots

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
3. Deletion on Termination:

if u Enable ---->Deletion on Termination i EC2  instance ---->it it'll not be deleted Accidentally.

Lab:
Go to AWS,
EC2,
Select instance----> Ubuntu-server
click on Instance state
u'll find Terminate (delete) instance?

if u see there,
Termination protection is disabled

if u click on ---->Terminate (delete) 
then ur EC2 instance will be deleted.

so i dot want to delete that,
i want choose/to do Deletion on Termination option

Go to AWS,
EC2,
Select instance----> Ubuntu-server
Actions,
Instance settings,
click on change termination protection,
now select/tick Enable 
save

Refresh EC2,

EC2,
Select instance----> Ubuntu-server
click on Instance state
u'll find Terminate (delete) instance?

if u see there,
Termination protection is Enable

even though if u delete the EC2 server,
it wont be deleting.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
4. AMI: (Amazon Machine Image)
* OS for EC2 instance
* Taking the Backup of ur Entire OS 
  or 
  customize version of ur OS. 

2 types of OS:
1. default OS / Images 
   ----> which r given by AWS

2. Customise OS/ Images 
   ----> we can create


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To create a Image:

$ mkdir ami
$ ls
ami

go to AWS,
EC2,
select EC2 instance,
Actions,
Images & Templates,
Create Image
:
: ---->select some options
:
Create Image

to check whether the image is created or not?

go to Images
AMI,

here,
u can see the images.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1. To create Default OS/Images:
Go to AWS console,
Services,
Search for ---->EC2,
Instances,
click on Launch Instance, 

Name: new server
OS: ubuntu 
AMI: 
:
:
:

& Launch the Instance

:::::::::::::::
2. To create Custom OS/Images:
Go to AWS console,
Services,
Search for ---->EC2,
Instances,
Quick AMI
or
My AMI's

select ur AMI & Launch the Instance

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Ami Usage case:
1. Local to AZ's / region 

Go to AWS console,

now ur in Mumbai region,

EC2,
AMI,
create AMI
there u'll find ---->Destination Region then select the region
copy AMI

now come to another region like if u want to go with Singapore

go to Singapore region,
EC2,
AMI's
here u can find AMI by name ---->first is copied. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
5. Snapshot : Taking Back up of ur EBS 
           volume.
           * Capturing screen
             or
             Photo copy of it
             or
             replica
             or
             duplicate copy

* wtever the data which is present at that point of time those details r Backup.

Screenshot: Photo copy of it
            or 
            Image will be captured


(Mumbai region)
Lab:
Go to AWS,
EC2,
Snapshot,
create a Snapshot,
select ---->Instance 
Instance ID: ---->select Ubuntu server ID

click on create Snapshot

wait for few mins
to create

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Diff b/w AMI & Snapshot?

AMI: ur taking the Entire Backup of 
     files, OS, Configuration file 
     for other services
or
* Backup of Entire EC2 instance
* customize OS
* Associated with EC2
* Ami is a Bootable copy of whole  
  EC2 instance.
* collection of snapshots

Snapshot: Backup of only EBS volumes 
          not EC2.
* Associated with EBS


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Q. How to take Backup of EBS Volume?
Ans: u can take Snapshot


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Use cases: 
Snapshot: EBS volumes r Local to that AZ's

* also copy AZ R to another AZ/R

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
6. Lifecycle Manager

if u want to take backup of Multiple EBS volumes, then we can opt for Lifecycle Manager

Lifecycle Manager: Automatically creates the Backup ofur snapshots/EBS volumes.

or
Automatically create a snapshot/backup,
of a EBS volume by using
Lifecycle Manager

go to AWS,
EC2,
Lifecycle Manager
Amazon Data
Lifecycle Manager
retention, 
copy 
and
deletion of snapshots
and 
AMIS


Create new lifecycle policy
Create custom or default policy
O Custom policy
O Default policy
Automate the creation,
Policy type
EBS snapshot policy
Next step

Lifecycle Policy
1. Custom policy
2. Default policy


retention: how many days u want to keep inside ur AWS account.

Done
