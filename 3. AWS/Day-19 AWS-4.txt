AWS Topics:
1. Elastic IP
2. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
3. Volumes or EBS volumes


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

1. Public IP: it is used to connect from the internet.

* if anyone have Public IP,
they can connect it from internet.

* ur  Public IP will always change,
when u start/stop/restart(reboot) ur server.

2. Private IP: it is used to connect only to the internal communication/ purpose.

* ur Private IP will never change.

Note:
whenever u start/restart the service,
this Public IP is getting changed/gives a new Pub IP.

But the private IP, 
will remains the same.

so whenever, 
i stop the server, 
i need my Public IP to be 
Constant IP/
Default IP/
Static IP/
Permanent IP to my EC2 server.

so how to create that? 

1. Elastic IP: it is a service which give static IP to ur EC2 server/Instance.

u can able to create a permanent IP/
static IP,
which will never change.

so that IP we can create & assign it to ur EC2 instance.
 
so wt happens is ....?
* Even if u start/restart/stop the server, 
this IP does not change.

----------------------
Lab:
AWS console,
EC2,
Elastic IP,
Allocate Elastic IP Address,
select Network region---->ap-south-ia or 1b...
Click on Allocate.

here,
Allocate means create.


now this EIP is created,
name it as first_eip,

so, 
now i need to attach this EIP(first_eip) to this EC2 server(ubuntu server)

go to EIP,
first_eip,
click Associate Elastic IP address,
Instance ---->choose ur EC2 server(i.e. ubuntu-server)
click on Associate


go to EC2,
Refresh,

in Ubuntu-server,
if u move right-side, u can see Elastic IP is Associated/assigned/connected.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Diff B/w Pubic IP & Elastic IP:
Public IP : Free
Elastic IP: Paid

::::::::::::::::::::::::::
go to EIP,
select first_eip,
Actions,
Disassociate Elastic IP Addresses,
Disassociate

Disassociate means removing Elastic IP add from Ubuntu-server.

go to EC2,
Ubuntu-server,
refresh it,
here,
ur Elastic IP is not there/release.

now again to go to EIP,
select first_eip,
Actions,
Release Elastic IP Addresses,
Release

now Elastic IP Address is deleted.

Note:
so this is how we can use EIP,
Create EIP,
Allocate,
Disassociate,
Release. 
from ur/any EC2 server.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2. Network Interfaces: is nothing but creating ur ENI(Elastic Network Interface)


Eg:
1. Local computer getting IP add by NIC card(Network interface card)

2. Virtual server getting public/private IP add by Elastic Network Interface(ENI)

* Elastic Network Interface(ENI)
 is a virtual card which provides IP's so that u can connect to the internet or to other computers.

* u can have/attach Max 5 ENI per machine.

* to increate ENI,
u need to mail AWS support.

* it is Local to Avaliablity Zone.
means,
if ur creating one ENI card in one 1a-AZ,
so if u want to create ENI card in another 1b-AZ not possible.
bcz,
1a-AZ is Local to that Availability Zone.
we cant use/crate same ENI card in one AZ,
not be used in another AZ's.

--------------------------------
Lab:
go to AWS console,
EC2,
Network Interfaces,
create Network Interfaces,

Description: name it---->abcd
Subnet: select subnet
SG: select SG

Create Network Interface


go to ENI,
abcd,
Actions,
Attach ENI,
VPC: select VPC,
Instance: select ur Instance
Attach.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
3. Volumes or EBS volumes: is nothing but Hard Disc/storage to ur EC2 server.

Local Laptop ---->Hard Disc Drive (HDD)----->(1TB) ---->Drives/Partitions like c,d,e drives

wt is the use of HDD?
to store movies, files


same for server,
u need Images,
store files,
u need hard disc/Partitions like c,d,e drives

in EC2 instances, 
we r creating a hard disc drive called a Volumes or EBS volumes

Elastic Block storage (EBS) volumes:
1. Virtual Hard Drive to EC2 instance.

2. Virtual storge volume, attach to EC2 instance.

3. Whenever u create a new EC2 instance,
By Default 1 EBS volume is gets created which is 8GB.
(from AWS)
this Drive or volume,
we call it as a Root Drive.  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Eg:
Laptop ---->1 TB

2 types of Drives:

1. HDD: Hard Disc Drive 
---->old technology
* for R/W operations r bit slow here
* IOPS is less
Eg:
* if ur a student for lesser budget,
  u can go for the HDD. 

2. Solid State Disc
---->New Technology 
* with R/W operations with increased performance.
* IOPS is more 
that's R/W we call it as IOPs
Eg:
* for Gamer need high performance.

IOPS: Input Output Per Sec 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::
wt type of Volume u required for EC2 instance?

Diff types of Volumes:

Volumes:
1. SSD
   1. General Purpose SSD 
      1. (gp3)
      2. (gp2)
   2. Provisioned IOPS SSD 
      1. (io1)
      2. (io2)
  
2. HDD
   1. Cold HDD (sc1)
   2. Throughput Optimized HDD(st 1)

3. Magnetic (standard) ---->old technologies

Q. How to decide wt kind of Hard Drive / Volume  u need in EC2?
Ans:
1. kind of performace
   like decreased/increased/mid performance
2. cost ---->high or low
3. IPOS ---->how  many jobs u want to perform in a single sec's
3. Throughput ----> no. of processes 
EC2 machine/volume can complete per second.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Q. I wanted to see wt is the Volume which is already there/exited in my EC2 instance?
or 
size of that volume?

Lab:
go to AWS,
EC2,
ubuntu -server,
copy Public IP

go to Desktop,
go to AWS Folder,
Git bash here,
$ ssh -i keyname.pem ununtu@publicip

yes
yes

ubuntu@ip $ lsblk 
:
:
xvda 202:0 0 8G 0 Disk ---->this is my total Hard disc
:
:----->multiple partitions
:

lsblk stands for List Block Storage
it gives the information about all of ur volumes 
like wt is the total size? 
which is used?

lsblk is a command which displays available EBS volumes which is attached to ur EC2 instance.

Interview Q'
Q. How do u attach volume to ur EC2 instance? tell me the steps
Ans: 
    To create a volume & attach to ur EC2 instance.

Steps:
1. Create a volume in AWS console,
2. Need to attach EBS volume to  
   which ever EC2 instance u want.
3. Create a File System
   like EXT4,ntfs,xvda,xfs,xvdf 
   
   $ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdv
     here,
     mkfs is make file system
     .ext4 is file name 
    /dev/xvdv ----> to u drive ur   
    creating? 
4. u just need to create directory 
   $ sudo  mkdir /cdrive
5. go to ur root directory,
   $ cd /
   $ ls
     :
     :
     cdrive ---->is created
6. u need to attach this File System to ur Directory
   $ sudo mount /dev/xvdv /cdrive 

   $ mountpoint /cdrive
    /cdrive is mountpoint ---->if u get this o/p,
    then ur successfully crated EBS volume & attached to one of ur cdrive.
   $ lsblk
     :
     :
     xvdv 5G  disk /cdrive

   $ cd /
   $ cd cdrive
   $ sudo touch 1  2 3
   $ ls
     1  
     2 
     3 ---->is created
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Lab:
1. create a volume in AWS console,

create volume
EC2,
EBS,
create volume,
volume type: gp3
size: 5 GB
AZ: ap-south-b

click on create volume

name  it as new-ebs-volume

volume state: is creating wait for few sec's,
it will be in available state

2. Need to attach EBS volume to which ever EC2 instance u want.

select the new-ebs-volume,
Actions,
Attach volume,
Instance ----->select ur EC2 instance
Device name: /dev/sdv

click on Attach volume

go to Ubuntu server,
ubuntu@ip $ lsblk 
:
:
xvda 202:0 0 8G 0 Disk 
:
:
:xvdv        5G disk ----->this is volume which we have attached to EC2 instance with 5GB

3. Create a File System

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdv
 

here,
mkfs is make file system
.ext4 is file name 
to u drive ur creating? ----?/dev/xvdv


$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdv
:
:

file system is created

how do confirm how do u created file system or not?
Ans: sudo file -s /dev/xvdv

$ sudo file -s /dev/xvdv
or
ubuntu@previous-hostname: ~ $ sudo file -s /dev/xvdv
dev/xvdv: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=21b69f7f-26e2-49ab-9e8c-8dff
17b098b7 (extents) (64bit) (large files) (huge files)  ------>by this command/ means file system is created
ubuntu@previous-hostname :~ $

4. u just need to create directory 
(note:under root directory u need to create it)
mkdir /cdrive
ubuntu@ip$
$ sudo  mkdir /cdrive
$ 

5. go to ur root directory,
$ cd /
$ ls
:
:
cdrive ---->is created

6. u need to attach this File System to ur Directory
$ sudo mount /dev/xvdv /cdrive 
$  ---->its attached/assigned

mount means attach ur volume to ur EC2 instance/folder

# to check whether this is attached to ur cdrive or not?
$ mountpoint /cdrive
/cdrive is mountpoint ---->if u get this o/p,
then ur successfully crated EBS volume & attached to one of ur cdrive.
$ 

$ lsblk
:
:
xvdv 5G  disk /cdrive

$ cd /
$ cd cdrive
$ sudo touch 1  2 3
$ ls
1  
2 
3 ---->is created

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Short Cut Explaination:

Q. How do u attach volume to ur EC2 instance?
Ans:
1. Create a volume,
2. Attach a volume to EC2 instance,
3. lsblk ---->it shows wtever  the volumes r available
4. file system  ---->create a file system
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdv
sudo file -s /dev/xvdv --->to confirm filesystem created or not ?
5. sudo mkdir new-dir --->to create a directory in root location
6. cd /
7. mount(attach) /dev/xvdv /cdrive
   mountpoint /cdrive --->to mount to directory
8. mountpoint /cdrive ---->to confirm whether its created or not?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Note:
EBS volumes must be created in the same AZ as of EC2 instance.
(same AZ)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Interview Q'
1. Created New EBS volume & succuffuly attach EC
2. Deatch 

umount is the command which is used to detach/remove EBS volume from ur EC2 instance.

$ umount /cdrive
umount: /cdrive must be superuser to unmount.

$ sudo umount /cdrive
umount: /cdrive: target is busy

so why it is not detaching/deleting/removing/unmount ?
bcz ur in Cdrive,

$ pwd
/cdrive

$ cd ..
$ pwd
$ sudo umount /cdrive
$ lsblk
:
:

$ mountpoint /cdrive 
/crive is not a mountpoint

or
come to AWS console,
Volumes,
new_ebs_volumes,
Action,
detach

if u see the volume state,
it will changes from In-Use to Available(no EC2 instances r used)
refresh it

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Create a New EC2 instance
& Attach a volume which is in detach

Go to AWS console,
Services,
Search for ---->EC2,
Instances,
click on Launch Instance, 

Name: new server
OS: ubuntu 
AMI: 
Instance type: t2.micro ---->1CPU, IGB
KP: create a new KP
KP name: new key
ed
KP

Launch Instance


login to server,
$ ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@public-ip

$ lsblk
:
:

root volume we r in now.

go to AWS console,
EBS,
volume,
Actions,
Attach volume,
select the instance ---->new server
device name: /dev/xvdbl

click on Attach volume

go to server,
$ lsblk
:
:
xvdbl 5gb is attached

so i want to remove file system in ubuntu server(1st server),
& 
not to attach file system in new server(2nd  server)

note:
here,
we should not attch file sytem in 2nd server

bcz we have already created a fs(in 1st server) during our initial stage,
so no need of creating a FS again in 2nd server.
if u try to create a new fs here (in 2nd server),

so for 2nd server,
we can not add/create fs,
wtever the content/files r available all r deleted,
so thats the reason,
we no need to create a fs again.

first fs is already exits,

Note:
do not create a fs(for 2nd + servers),
as its already exits.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
#not to use this command
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdv

as it will delete the previous content/files
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

$ sudo file -s /dev/xvdbl
:
:----->file sytem is already there,
so no need to create file system
$  

$ mkdir /second
error

$ sudo !!

or
$ sudo mkdir /second

$ cd /
$ ls
/second
$ sudo mount /dev/xvdbl
/second
$ mountpint/second
/second is mountpint 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Done
