AWS:

Key Pair:
































Realtime Q'

in AWS, 
EC2,
in Metadata,
u can see Key pair name : DevOpsB29

imagine if key pair is gone/deleted(both pem & ppk)

1. DevOpsB29 ---->key pair is gone from EC2
2. Laptop keypair is gone(private key)

how to retrive back?

Ans:
1st method,

go to AWS IAM,
Roles,
Create a Role,
Step:1
select trusted entity
select---->EC2
----------->next
Step:2
Add permissions
search or select for administrator access
----------->next
Steps:3
Name, review and create
Role name: DevOpsB29-EC2-Role
----------->Create a Role

role will be creating

after creating role,

go to EC2,
refresh it,
select DevOpsB29-ShellScripting
right click on that,
security,
modify IAM role,
select created role by name ---->DevOpsB29-ShellScripting(from drop down)
----->update role

wait for 5-6 mins(in production wait for 5-6 mins)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
2nd method
(in RT, 
we should not delete/stop/reboot/shutdown the server, 
how to achive this?)
by for me i need now,
right click on DevOpsB29-ShellScripting,
u'll find reboot instance,

after it up

go to AWS services,

Management & Governance,
systems manager---->open in new window/tab,

left side down click on session manager,
click on start a session
(Complete down, u'll find session manager),
there down u'll find ur machine---->DevOpsB29-ShellScripting,

select DevOpsB29-ShellScripting,
click on start session

$ bash ----->if u type bash
ssm-ser@ip:/var/snap/amazon-ssm-agent/5656$ sudo su -
root@ip:~# su - ubuntu
ubuntu@ip:$ nano .ssh/authorized_keys

click on Enter

then down u can find the keys

we need public key,
so go to putty gen,
load,(load ur laptop key)
select all files,
select laptop key
save 
ok

when u load---->u'll find ur public key in Putty key generator
10:17
copy & paste it in ur notepad
(note: dont copy ---->imported-openssh-key)

go to ssm,

press shift+insert (means its going to paste it here)

control "O" + enter
&
control "X"

ubuntu@ip:$
$ cat .ssh/authorized_keys
u'll find the pub key here

so by this way we can get/generate/retrive key pair
