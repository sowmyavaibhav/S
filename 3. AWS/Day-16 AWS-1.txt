AWS:

1. Server: is nothing but another/a computer through which ur going provide the service.
           or
           is nothing but a computer that provides info to other computers called clients through a network.

 Host(installing)   Clients
                   
                    Clients

                    Clients


    Client<------------------->Server
    (Request/response Architecture)

2. 2 Types of Servers(Cloud):
  
   1. ON-PREM Server
   2. Cloud Service Server

  1. ON-PREM Server------>ABC company(banking app/phone pay)

if this server is created, 
                  used,
                  managed 
                  by a company/org itself is ON-PREM Servers.

  2. Cloud Service Server

     we r going to 
     create the servers,
     use the servers,
     but not going to manage by us is Cloud Service server.

3. 2 Types of Cloud Servers:
   1. Public Cloud
   2. Private Cloud

      1. Public Cloud:
         any one can come 
         &
         create the server

         Eg: AWS, Azure, GCP

      2. Private Cloud:
         it is restricted/specified/Authorized companies will create the servers

         Eg: Alibaba cloud, IBM, OpenStack
             (only specified by org)


4. Regions: Geographical Area/Physical location/AWS DC
         or 
         a specific area where AWS has its Data Centers/services multiple locations through out the Globe.

5. Availability Zones: its a collection of /Multiple Data centers.
   or
   Areas inside ur Region.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Google---->AWS Global Infrastructure
34 launched Regions
each with multiple Availability Zones

108 Availability Zones
600+ CloudFront POPs
and 13 Regional edge caches
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

6. DC: Physical WRACKs
    * min 2 DC in each AZ.

7. High Availability: 24/7 need to provide service

8. Fault Tolerance: if there r any Natural Disasters,
                    just to take backup of this data.

9. WRACK: in each wrack we have Hypervisor

10. Hypervisor: Machine devices,
               which helps us to create the server.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Region---->Availability Zone(AZ)---->DC---->WRACK---->Hypervisor(machine/nw device/individual rooms)

inside ur Hypervisor, u'll create EC2 servers

Note:
Inside Mumbai Region
Inside AZ
Inside DC
Inside Wrack
Inside Hypervisor
Inside EC2 machine will create a server.

Done
