Topics:
1. 

Instead of creating Infra for hosting/developing ur application manually
we have automated this process(infra creation using a concept IAC or Terraform)

to perform some activity known as Configuration Activity on to these machines 
if a machine is given,
u need to make sure 
*  whether particular package / software is installed or uninstalled
* whether the service is started or stopped.
* a particular user has a particular access
* whether this particular user is exited in this server or not?
* whether this particular user has a specific access.
* particular file/folder is available?
* automatic backups to the OS is available?

so all these activities combinedly called it as Configuration Activity.

or
Configuration Activity: Making sure some activity available or not like installing/files/folders/backup etc.,

Configuration: ur going to do some activity inside this machine.

Instead of doing manually,
we can perform automatically by the tool called as Ansible.

(terraform lo Multiple infra/EC2 created chesaka,
Configuration management tools tho connect iyi,
task perform chestam automatically)

Ansible: is a Configuration Management tool.

* day to day activities we can perform like installing tools ---->zoom, git installation, MS, chrome etc.,
which will perform/configure these activities on behalf of us.

Provisioners = = Ansible

Tf provisioners r same as equal to Ansible.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Terraform Architechture:
in a machine,
once terraform is installed,
will write/create a file in HCL language,
in this file we will mention a desire state
(wtever the infra i wanted to create,
that info im specifying in desire state.)
1. desire state
2. Provider ---->to which provider i want to connect(provider details)

once the file is ready.
will used to execute some commands like Init,Plan,Apply,Destroy

once its done,
tf itself will connect to the AWS EC2 server,
it'll create the infra
&
creates a statefile.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Ansible Architechture:

in one Machine,
first we will install Ansible to it.
this machine we call it as Ansible controller.

once its installed Ansible,
we r going to write/create a file in YAML/Yet another marker-up language

Q. wt it specifies?????
Ans: wt r the machines which my ansible need to connect
2. & wt is my desire state
here desire state is wt is the packages u want to install?
like  
* to install Appache web server into 100 machines
* to install Hdpd 100 details
& at the same time will gove/provide the desire state.

once this is done,
will execute some ansible commands here,
once execution is done,
then ansible will try to connect to each & every machine 

by using SSH 
(if it is Linux machines),

by using winrm 
(if it is windows machines). 

Note:****
whenever ur installing Ansible/Ansible controller,
the OS must be Linux only.

then wt happens? next?
1. 1st it will connects to this machines,
2. it will gather/collect/read the facts.

gather facts ---->existing information

(here facts means ---->existing machines configuration/wtever the things avaliable in this machines {git available or not? wtever the existing configuration available here in the machine,
it will going to READ})

3. Gather Facts/ Comapares 

once its done/reads,
it will Compare ur gather facts with ur desired state(wtever the thing u want in ur file)in ur machines

if there r no changes,
comapre GF = Desire state
       git = git ---->if git installed in both state
      * no change

if need to install,
it will installs & node state/update node state

here update is to install new state.

these servers r called Node state
like Node1, Node2, Node3....
-----------------------------
Telugu Explaination:

oka server lo ansible install chesi,
dantlo oka file create chesi,
oka desire state rasi,
ansible commands run chesi,
adi EC2 machines ki connect avutundi,
by using SSH or Winrm,
once its connected,
it connects through Gather Facts (GF),
GF ----->READS the existing machine configuration
or details available in the machine

once this activity is done,
it will comapare this existing info with our desire state.
* if there is no changes, then it just executes.
* if there is a changes, it will go install some package into this machines,
then it will change/update the Node state.
its going to installs.

Advantage of Ansible:
* PUSH based mechanisms
* no agent /Agent Less
* Ansible controller will connect to ur machine
* easy set-up
* no programming language.
------------------------- 
Compare :

Ansible, Chef, Puppet


1.Chef, Puppet

client/Agent           chef/puppet
   (EC2)              (controller)

client/Agent           
   (EC2)

chef/puppet: It works on the principal of PULL Based Machanism,

PULL Based Machanism: ur agent,which ever in ur EC2 instance,
will(client/Agent) connect to ur chef controller machine,
& 
it will take the software/wtever it will be.
so it is pulling from the controller machine.

by using the language python/Ruby

its a complicated set.

Problems with Chef/Puppet:
* Agent based tools
* PULL Based
* Python/Ruby programming language.
* complicated set-up

Advantage of Ansible:
* PUSH based mechanisms
* no agent /Agent Less
* Ansible controller will connect to ur machine
* easy to set-up
* no programming language./no need domain specific language.

Q. Y Ansible, we have terraform right?
